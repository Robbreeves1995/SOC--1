# SOC--1
I am taking on the role of a SOC analyst that is tasked with investigating a website defacement incident. I  will be using various tools like Splunk, and a FortiGate intrusion detection system (IDS), to identify the attack vector and root cause of the incident. 

This hands-on exercise taught me you how to analyze logs, identify vulnerabilities, and take proactive measures to prevent future incidents.



Key Objectives- 
- Analyze logs to identify the root cause of the incident.
- Understand attack vectors and exploitation techniques commonly used by hackers.
- Identify vulnerabilities in web servers and applications that can be exploited by attackers.
- Gain knowledge of proactive security measures that can be taken to prevent similar incidents.
- Gain practical experience in incident response.
